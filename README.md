# TreeQuery
TreeQuery is an interactive Python program designed to analyze and provide insights into New York City's tree data. Developed by Ann Lee, David Ugalde, Jenny Zhang, and Nadia Fayed, this tool reads data from a CSV file and offers a user-friendly command-line interface for querying the dataset.

The program empowers users to explore tree species, discover nearby trees, identify popular tree species, and access a list of valid commands for interaction. It extracts valuable information, such as total tree counts, zip codes where trees are found, and the borough with the highest tree count.
